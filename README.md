# Introduction

This is an idiomatic, minimally-opinionated `Channel` type for JavaScript that's inspired by [Go](https://golang.org/)'s concurrency model.  It works in browsers and in Node.js.  If you know how to use `Array` then you already know most of how to use `Channel`.

## Why

Go's concurrency model is amazing and with JavaScript's async/await feature we have the basis for it as well.  All that's missing is a `Channel` type.  There are existing libraries that implement one but they're generally ports from other languages and don't feel like they were made for JavaScript.  I wanted an idiomatic `Channel` type that's simple and minimally-opinionated.

This document assumes you're familiar with Go's concurrency model and why you'd want to use it.  For explanatory background, read my [blog article](https://www.NodeGuy.com/concurrency-in-javascript) on the subject.

## Requirements

ES 2017

## Installation

```shell
$ npm install @nodeguy/channel
```

## Basic Use

Create a channel with `Channel()`.

To send an value to a channel, use `push`.  To receive an value from a channel, use `shift`.  Always precede the method calls with `await`:

```JavaScript
const assert = require('assert')
const Channel = require('@nodeguy/channel')

const channel = Channel()

;(async () => {
  await channel.push(42)
})()

;(async () => {
  assert.equal(await channel.shift(), 42)
})()
```

The `push` and `shift` methods are usually called in different async functions.  They represent the two different ends of the channel and act to coordinate the behavior of the async functions.

# API

## New Properties

The following properties don't have equivalents in `Array`.

### close() -> async

Closes the channel so that no more values can be pushed to it.  Returns a promise that resolves when any remaining pushes in flight complete.

Attempting to push to a closed channel will throw an exception and shifting from a closed channel will immediately return `undefined`.

### readOnly() -> Channel

Returns a version of the channel that provides only read methods.

### value

Set to the most recently `shift`ed value.  This is useful when used in combination with `select`.

### writeOnly() -> Channel

Returns a version of the channel that provides only write methods.

### Channel.select(methods) -> async channel

`Channel.select` attempts to call multiple channel `methods` in parallel and returns the channel of the first one that succeeds.  Only the winning method is executed to completionâ€”the other methods have no effect.

#### Examples

Imagine you're at a party and your next conversation depends on whom you run
into first: Alice, Bob, or Charlie.

```JavaScript
switch (await Channel.select(alice.shift(), bob.shift(), charlie.push(`Hi!`)) {
  case alice:
    console.log(`Alice said ${alice.value}.`)
    break

  case bob:
    console.log(`Bob said ${bob.value}.`)
    break

  case charlie:
    console.log(`I said "hi" to Charlie.`)
    break
}
```

Be careful of unintended side effects, however.  Even though only one value is pushed in the following example, the counter is incremented twice.

```
let counter = 0

const increment = () => {
  counter++
  return counter
}

await Channel.select(alice.push(increment()), bob.push(increment()))
assert.equal(counter, 2)
```

Sometimes you don't want to wait until a method completes.  You can use this pattern to return immediately even if no methods are ready:

```JavaScript
const closed = Channel()
closed.close()

switch (await Channel.select(alice.shift(), bob.shift(), closed.shift()) {
  case alice:
    console.log(`Alice said ${alice.value}.`)
    break

  case bob:
    console.log(`Bob said ${bob.value}.`)
    break

  default:
    console.log(`No one has anything to say yet.`)
}
```

You can also arrange it so that the select completes within a timeout:

```JavaScript
const timeout = Channel()
setTimeout(timeout.close, 1000)

switch (await Channel.select(alice.shift(), bob.shift(), timeout.shift()) {
  case alice:
    console.log(`Alice said ${alice.value}.`)
    break

  case bob:
    console.log(`Bob said ${bob.value}.`)
    break

  default:
    console.log(`I stopped listening after one second.`)
}
```

## Array-like Methods

These methods are similar to the equivalently named methods of `Array`.

### Channel

#### Channel([bufferLength = 0]) -> Channel

Create a new `Channel` with an optional buffer.

#### Channel.of(...values) -> Channel

#### Channel.from(iterable | stream.Readable) -> Channel

Create a new `Channel` from an iterable or a [Node.js readable stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_readable_streams).

### Channel Object

#### filter(callbackfn[, thisArg]) -> Channel
#### forEach(callbackfn[, thisArg]) -> async

The promise returned by `forEach` resolves when the channel is closed:

```JavaScript
const toArray = async (channel) => {
  const array = []

  await channel.forEach((value) => {
    array.push(value)
  })

  return array
}
```

If `callbackfn` is async then `forEach` will wait for it before iterating to the next value:

```JavaScript
const pipe = async (source, sink) => {
  await source.forEach(sink.push)
  sink.close()
}
```

#### join(separator) -> async String
#### map(callbackfn[, thisArg]) -> Channel
#### push(value) -> async bufferLength

Unlike `Array`'s method, `push` accepts only one `value` at a time.

Sends the value into the channel and returns a promise that resolves when the value has been shifted out or placed in the buffer.

* Throws a `TypeError` when attempting to push to a closed channel.
* Throws a `TypeError` when attempting to push `undefined` because it's a reserved value used to indicate a closed channel.

#### reduce(callbackfn[, initialValue])
#### shift() -> Promise

Returns a promise that resolves when an value is received from the channel.  Closed channels always return `undefined` immediately.

#### slice(start, end) -> Channel
